# Satellite  Analysis â€“ UK Night Time Lights as a Procy for Economic Growth

This project visualises night time light intensity across the UK using VIIRS satellite data from January 2025. Nighttime lights are used as a proxy for economic activity, urbanisation, and infrastructure, with city-level annotations overlaid for visual clarity.

The final result is a heatmap of the UK.
